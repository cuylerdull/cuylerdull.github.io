          ...is Northwestern University's Formula SAE team (NUFSAE). <a target="_blank" class = "formula-text-link" href="https://www.fsaeonline.com/">Formula SAE</a> is an intercollegiate engineering competition created by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Each year, engineering universities from across the world design, manufacture, test, and race formula-style cars to compete in this competition. The rules and regulations set forth by SAE demand from each competing team creativity, design thinking, and engineering prowess. Read below on how I contributed to Northwestern's 17-18 vehicle.

          <div class = "formula-content1">As a member of the aerodynamics subteam, I worked on the design, manufacturing, and testing of the wings and bodywork of our car. Specifically, I worked with NUFSAE leadership to optimize our rear wing configuration with CFD software. Additionally, I manufactured many carbon fiber layups for structural members as well as aerodynamic components.</div>
